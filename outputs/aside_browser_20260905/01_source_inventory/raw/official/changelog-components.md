* \[Fix] **Image attachments**: Aside converts HEIC attachments to PNG before the agent reads them and reports broken JPEGs. It preserves previews for formats outside the resize pipeline, including AVIF and SVG.
* \[Fix] **Chat stability**: Chat holds your reading position while a task streams and when you reopen a session. Failed favicons fall back to initials without triggering an error screen.
* \[Fix] **Notification use**: The Notification Use page hides Aside's task-status notifications and limits long previews to four lines.
* \[Fix] **Omnibox navigation**: Aside opens `aside://` addresses entered in the search omnibox as internal Chrome pages.
* \[Fix] **Vault sync**: Aside recovers missing or conflicted vault records without changing stored values and repairs verified legacy sync metadata.
* \[Fix] **Passkeys**: Aside prevents assertion counter conflicts when new passkeys sync across devices.

## v1.26.716.1706
